# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

A machine learning project that uses logistic regression to classify Iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* based on petal and sepal features.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The goal is to predict the class of Iris flower species using the classic Iris dataset. This is a supervised classification task.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of:
- 150 samples
- 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- 4 features: 
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width

## ðŸ§  ML Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Data Preprocessing
- Train/Test Split
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Accuracy Achieved**: _e.g., 96%_
- Model performed well in separating Setosa but had slight overlap between Versicolor and Virginica.

## ðŸ“Š Visualization
Plots included in the notebook for:
- Pairplots of features
- Decision boundaries
- Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
